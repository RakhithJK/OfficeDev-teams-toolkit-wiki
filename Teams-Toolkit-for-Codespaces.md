# Using Teams Toolkit for App Development in Codespaces

## Introduction
[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) is a cloud-based development environment for your GitHub projects that allows developers to develop and collaborate on code from anywhere, using a web browser or Visual Studio Code. With GitHub Codespaces, Teams Toolkit provides new "install-less" getting started experience for Teams app development, so you can quickly get started with a fully configured dev environment without spending time on local environment setup.
