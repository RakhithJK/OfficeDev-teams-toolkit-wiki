# Using Teams Toolkit for App Development in Codespaces

## Introduction
[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) is a cloud-based development environment for your GitHub projects that allows developers to develop and collaborate on code from anywhere, using a web browser or Visual Studio Code. With GitHub Codespaces, Teams Toolkit provides new "install-less" getting started experience for Teams app development, so you can quickly get started with a fully configured dev environment without spending time on local environment setup.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started building Teams app with Codespaces, please make sure: 
1. You have a GitHub account which will be used to create a Codespaces instance.
2. You have a M365 Account with sideloading permissions. You may find the setup instructions in the [Prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant). If you donâ€™t already have a Microsoft 365 account, you can register for a free one through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).
