## Why I need to Provision

This section introduces different situations you need to provision your project. If you are suggested by the Toolkit to provision your project, check whether you are one of them.

1. If your project has not been successfully provisioned yet and you choose to deploy or publish it, toolkit will ask you to provision first.
1. If your project contains bot capability and has already been successfully provisioned and just got upgrated by Toolkit to enable insider feafures, the upgrate of project requires re-provision of bot Azure resources. So the toolkit ask you to provision again before deploy or publish your project.
