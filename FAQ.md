## Why I need to Provision

This section introduces different situations you need to provision your project. If you are suggested by the Toolkit to provision your project, check whether you are one of them.

1. If your project has not been successfully provisioned yet and you choose to deploy or publish it, toolkit will ask you to provision first.
2. If your project contains bot capability which has already been successfully provisioned and just got upgrade by Toolkit, the project requires re-provision bot resource since toolkit helps upgrade Bot Channels Registration to Azure Bot Service, due to Bot Channels Registration become a [legacy production](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=userassigned#create-the-resource). So you will be asked to provision again before deploy or publish the project. If you still want to use existing bot, please follow [these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=userassigned#create-the-resource).
