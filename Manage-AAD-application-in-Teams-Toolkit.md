# AAD manifest introduction

> This feature is currently under active development. Report any issues to us [here](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/issues/new/choose).

The [Azure Active Directory manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest) contains a definition of all the attributes of an AAD application object in the Microsoft identity platform. 

Teams Toolkit now manages AAD application with this manifest file as the source of truth during your Teams application development lifecycles.

## How to customize the AAD manifest template

User can customize AAD manifest template to update AAD application.

1. Open `aad.template.json` in your project
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/167983903-7093ee6b-6378-4e00-936e-1912f742ccfc.png)

1. Update the template directly or [reference values from another file](#Placeholders-in-AAD-manifest-template). Below we have provided several customization scenarios:
    * [Add an application permission](#Customize-requiredResourceAccess)
    * [Preauthorize a client application](#Customize-preAuthorizedApplications)
    * [Update redirect URL for authentication response](#Customize-redirect-URLs)

1. Follow this [instruction](#How-to-deploy-AAD-application-changes-for-local-environment) to deploy your AAD application changes for local environment
1. Follow this [instruction](#How-to-deploy-AAD-application-changes-for-remote-environment) to deploy your AAD application changes for remote environment.

### Customize requiredResourceAccess

If your Teams app required more permissions to call API with additional permissions, you need to update `requiredResourceAccess` property in the AAD manifest template. Here is an example for this property:

```json
"requiredResourceAccess": [
    {
        "resourceAppId": "Microsoft Graph",
        "resourceAccess": [
            {
                "id": "User.Read", // For Microsoft Graph API, you can also use uuid for permission id
                "type": "Scope" // Scope is for delegated permission
            },
            {
                "id": "User.Export.All",
                "type": "Role" // Role is for application permission
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "resourceAppId": "Office 365 SharePoint Online",
        "resourceAccess": [
            {
                "id": "AllSites.Read",
                "type": "Scope"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

    * `resourceAppId` property is for different APIs, for `Microsoft Graph` and `Office 365 SharePoint Online`, you can input the name directly instead of uuid, and for other APIs, you need to use uuid.
    * `resourceAccess.id` property is for different permissions, for `Microsoft Graph` and `Office 365 SharePoint Online`, you can input the permission name directly instead of uuid, and for other APIs, you need to use uuid.
    * `resourceAccess.type` property is used for delegated permission or application permission. `Scope` means delegated permission and `Role` means application permission.

### Customize preAuthorizedApplications

You can use `preAuthorizedApplications` property to authorize a client application indicates that this API trusts the application and users should not be asked to consent when the client calls this exposed API.
Here is an example for this property:

```json
    "preAuthorizedApplications": [
        {
            "appId": "1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264",
            "permissionIds": [
                "{{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.oauth2PermissionScopeId}}"
            ]
        }
        ...
    ]
```

`preAuthorizedApplications.appId` property is used for the application you want to authorize. If you doesn't know the application id but only knows the application name, you can go to Azure Portal following this steps to search the application to find the id:

1. Go to Azure Portal and open [app registrations(https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)
1. Click `All applications` and search the application name
1. If you find the application that you search for, you can click the application and get the application id from the overview page

<p align="right"><a href="#AAD-manifest-introduction">back to top</a></p>

### Customize redirect URLs

Redirect URLs is used when returning authentication responses (tokens) after successfully authenticating. You can customize redirect URLs using property `replyUrlsWithType`, for example, if you want to add `https://www.examples.com/auth-end.html` as redirect URL, you can add it as below:

```json
"replyUrlsWithType": [
    ...
    {
        "url": "https://www.examples.com/auth-end.html",
        "type": "Spa"
    }
]
```

<p align="right"><a href="#AAD-manifest-introduction">back to top</a></p>

## Placeholders in AAD manifest template

AAD manifest template file contains placeholder arguments with `{{...}}` statements. These statements will be replaced at build time for different environments. With placeholder arguments, you can make references to config file, state file and environment variables.

### Reference state file values in AAD manifest template

State file is located in `.fx\states\state.xxx.json` (xxx is represent different environment). A typical state file is as below:

```json
{
    "solution": {
        "teamsAppTenantId": "uuid",
        ...
    },
    "fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams": {
        "applicationIdUris": "api://xxx.com/uuid",
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

If you want to reference `applicationIdUris` value in `fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams` property, you can use this placeholder argument in the AAD manifest: `{{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.applicationIdUris}}`

### Reference config file values in AAD manifest template

Config file is located in `.fx\configs\config.xxx.json` (xxx is represent different environment). A typical config file is as below:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config-schema",
  "description": "description.",
  "manifest": {
    "appName": {
      "short": "app",
      "full": "Full name for app"
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to reference `short` value, you can use this placeholder argument in the AAD manifest: `{{config.manifest.appName.short}}`

### Reference environment variable in AAD manifest template

Sometimes you may not want to hardcode the values in AAD manifest template. For example, when the value is a secret. AAD manifest template file supports referencing the values from environment variables. You can use syntax `{{env.YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}}` in parameter values to tell the tooling that the value needs to be resolved from current environment variable.

## How to author and preview AAD manifest with code lens

AAD manifest template file has code lens to help you better review and edit it.

![codelens-overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/168004906-685f2ed8-984b-4dd7-a491-bd5f136d116c.png)


### Preview AAD manifest template file

At the beginning of the AAD manifest template file, there is a preview codelens. Click this codelens, it will generate AAD manifest based on the environment you selected.

![codelens-preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/168004969-08536b83-1d47-4832-810e-a772243509de.png)

### Placeholder argument code lens

Placeholder argument has code lens to help you take quick look of the values for local debug and develop environment. If your mouse hover on the placeholder argument, it will show tooltip box for the values of all the environment.

![codelens-placeholder-argument](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/168005056-98843db4-d926-4ed6-9cde-3f8e31925ff4.png)

### Required resource access code lens

Different from official [AAD manifest schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest) that `resourceAppId` and `resourceAccess` id in `requiredResourceAccess` property only support uuid, AAD manifest template in Teams Toolkit also support user readable strings for `Microsoft Graph` and `Office 365 SharePoint Online` permissions. If you input uuid, codelens will show user readable strings, otherwise, codelens will show uuid.

![codelens-resource-access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/168005130-1c81c010-836c-47db-a05c-84e402f02387.png)

### Pre-authorized applications code lens

For `preAuthorizedApplications` property, code lens will show the application name for the per-authorized application id.

## AAD application in Teams app development lifecycle

You would interact with AAD application during various stages of your Teams app development lifecycle and here is how Teams Toolkit makes it easy.

### 1. Project creation

You can create a project with Teams Toolkit that comes with SSO support by default. Such as `SSO-enabled tab`. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/create-new-project) for how to create a new Teams app with Teams Toolkit. An AAD manifest file will be automatically created for you: `templates\appPackage\aad.template.json`. Teams Toolkit will create or update the AAD application during local development or when you move your application to the cloud.

### 2. Add SSO to your Bot or Tab capability
If you created a Teams application without SSO built-in, Teams Toolkit can incrementally help you [add SSO](https://teamsfx-add-sso) to your project. As a result, An AAD manifest file will be automatically created for you: `templates\appPackage\aad.template.json`. Teams Toolkit will create or update the AAD application during next local debug session or when you move your application to the cloud.

### 3. Local development

During local development (known as `F5`), Teams Toolkit will:
* Check if there is an existing AAD application by reading the `state.local.json` file. If yes, Teams Toolkit will re-use the existing AAD application otherwise we will create a new one using the `aad.template.json` file.

* When creating a new AAD application with the manifest file, some properties in the manifest file which require additional context (such as `replyUrls` property that requires a local debug endpoint) will be ignored first.

* After the local dev environment startup successfully, the AAD application's `identifierUris`, `replyUrls`, and other properties which are not available during creation stage will be updated accordingly.

* Changes you made to your AAD application will be loaded during next local debug session. Optionally you can follow this [instruction](How-to-deploy-AAD-application-changes-for-local-environment) if you want to manually apply AAD application changes.

### 4. Provision cloud resources

When moving your application to the cloud, you would need to provision cloud resources and deploy your application. At these stages, like local development, Teams Toolkit will:

* Check if there is an existing AAD application by reading `state.{env}.json` file. If yes, Teams Toolkit will re-use the existing AAD application otherwise we will create a new one using the `aad.template.json` file.

* When creating a new AAD application with the manifest file, some properties in the manifest file which require additional context (such as `replyUrls` property requires frontend or bot endpoint) will be ignored first.

* After other resources provision completes, the AAD application's `identifierUris` and `replyUrls` will be updated accordingly to the correct endpoints.

### 5. Application deployment

* `Deploy to the cloud` command will deploy your application to the provisioned resources. This will not include deploying AAD application changes you made.
* You can follow this [instruction](#How-to-deploy-AAD-application-changes-for-remote-environment) to deploy AAD application changes for remote environment
* Teams Toolkit will update the AAD application according to the AAD manifest template file.
> Please note, when deploying AAD application for remote environment, you need to trigger provision first.

## Known limitations

1. Not all the properties listed in [AAD manifest schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest) are supported in Teams Toolkit extension, this tab show the properties that are not supported:

    | Not supported properties   | Reason                     |
    | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
    | passwordCredentials        | Not allowed in manifest    |
    | createdDateTime            | Readonly and cannot change |
    | logoUrl                    | Readonly and cannot change |
    | publisherDomain            | Readonly and cannot change |
    | oauth2RequirePostResponse  | Doesn't exist in Graph API |
    | oauth2AllowUrlPathMatching | Doesn't exist in Graph API |
    | samlMetadataUrl            | Doesn't exist in Graph API |
    | orgRestrictions            | Doesn't exist in Graph API |
    | certification              | Doesn't exist in Graph API |

1. Currently `requiredResourceAccess` property can use user readable resource app name or permission name strings only for `Microsoft Graph` and `Office 365 SharePoint Online` APIs. For other APIs, you need to use uuid instead. You can follow these steps retrieve ids from Azure Portal:

    1. [Register a new AAD application](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) on Azure Portal.
    1. Click `API permissions` from the AAD application page.
    1. Click `Add a permission` to add the permission you want.
    1. Click `Manifest`, from the `requiredResourceAccess` property, you can find the ids of API and permissions.
