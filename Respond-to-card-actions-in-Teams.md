The Adaptive Card action handler feature enables the app to respond to adaptive card actions that triggered by end users to complete a sequential workflow. When user gets an Adaptive Card, it can provide one or more buttons in the card to ask for user's input, do something like calling some APIs, and then send another adaptive card in conversation to response to the card action.

## How to create a workflow bot

### In Visual Studio Code

1. From Teams Toolkit sidebar click `Create a new Teams app` or select `Teams: Create a new Teams app` from command palette.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/192237560-e55fb669-88a8-4423-b5e5-49c6f7b3c6fc.png)

2. Select `Create a new Teams app`.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/192237688-4241d52e-b892-42a3-8857-dccfbd1c7013.png)

3. Select the `Workflow bot` from Scenario-based Teams app section.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/192220388-910a2708-ab57-4492-b942-4be3b3ea9930.png)

4. Select programming language.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/192237785-e926d9ec-5b97-40a0-8983-ab2db71383ca.png)

5. Enter an application name and then press enter.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11220663/192237915-8ac2c4f3-2cc3-4700-886c-78cda235c835.png)

### In TeamsFx CLI

* If you prefer interactive mode, execute `teamsfx new` command, then use the keyboard to go through the same flow as in Visual Studio Code.
* If you prefer non-interactive mode, enter all required parameters in one command.

`teamsfx new --interactive false --capabilities "workflow-bot" --programming-language "typescript" --folder "./" --app-name myWorkflowBot`

After you successfully created the project, you can quickly start local debugging via `F5` in VSCode. Select `Debug (Edge)` or `Debug (Chrome)` debug option of your preferred browser. You can send a `helloWorld` command after running this template and get a response as below:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10163840/192477792-dc447b3a-e304-4cd8-b4df-b1eb9d226292.png" alt="initial-response" width="600"/>

Then you can click the `DoStuff` button to invoke the action, and you will received the following updated adaptive card:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10163840/192477148-29d9edfc-085b-4d02-b3de-b47b9a456108.png" alt="action-response" width="600"/>

## Take a tour of your app source code
### For JS/TS project (in Visual Studio Code)
The created app is a normal TeamsFx project that will contain following folders:

| Folder | Contents |
| - | - |
| `.fx` | Project level settings, configurations, and environment information |
| `.vscode` | VSCode files for local debug |
| `bot` | The source code for the workflow bot Teams application |
| `templates` | Templates for the Teams application manifest and for provisioning Azure resources |

The core implementation for the Teams bot is in `bot/` folder.
The following files under `bot/` folder provide the business logic for the workflow bot. These files can be updated to fit your business logic requirements. The default implementation provides a starting point to help you get started:

| File | Contents |
| - | - |
| `src/index.js(ts)` | Application entry point and `restify` handlers for the workflow bot |
| `src/adaptiveCards/helloworldCommand.json` | A generated Adaptive Card that is sent to Teams |
| `src/commands/helloworldCommandHandler.js(ts)` | Responds to the command message |
| `src/cardActions/doStuffActionHandler.js(ts)` | Responds to the `doStuff` card action |
| `src/cardModels.js(ts)` | The default Adaptive Card data model |

The following files implement the core workflow bot on the Bot Framework. You generally will not need to customize these files.

| File / Folder | Contents |
| - | - |
| `src/internal/initialize.js(ts)` | Application initialization and bot message handling |

The following files are project-related files. You generally will not need to customize these files.

| File / Folder | Contents |
| - | - |
| `.gitignore` | Git ignore file |
| `package.json` | NPM package file |

<p align="right"><a href="#How-to-create-a-workflow-bot">back to top</a></p>

## Card Action Handler
To simplify the development, the TeamsFx SDK provides an adaptive card action handler (`TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler`) to let developers only focus on the development of business logic to respond to the card action without learning the Bot Framework SDK.
 
### How it works?
The following diagram illustrated how to respond to a adaptive card action with TeamsFx SDK:
![image](https://github.com/dooriya/WorkflowBot/blob/main/assets/card-action.png)

* `Action Card`: the card where you define your action that users can invoke (click button).
* `Response Card`: the card to respond to the action when user invoke it from the action card.
* `Card Action Handler`: triggered when user invoke the corresponding card action (its `triggerVerb` is same as the `verb` property in adaptive card action). And it will send a response card to respond to the action.

To handle card actions with TeamsFx SDK, each card action handler should implement `TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler` interface. Below is the interface definition for `TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler`:

```typescript
export interface TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler {
    /**
     * The verb defined in adaptive card action that can trigger this handler.
     */
    triggerVerb: string;

    /**
     * Specify the behavior for how the card response will be sent in Teams conversation.
     * The default value is `AdaptiveCardResponse.ReplaceForInteractor`, which means the card
     * response will replace the current one only for the interactor.
     */
    adaptiveCardResponse?: AdaptiveCardResponse;
    
    /**
     * The handler function that will be invoked when the action is fired.
     * @param context The turn context.
     * @param actionData The contextual data that associated with the action.
     */
    handleActionInvoked(context: TurnContext, actionData: any): Promise<InvokeResponse>;
}
```
<p align="right"><a href="#How-to-create-a-workflow-bot">back to top</a></p>

## Customize the initialization

The default initialization is located in `bot/src/internal/initialize.js(ts)`.

You can update the initialization logic to:

- Set `options.adapter` to use your own `BotFrameworkAdapter`
- Set `options.command.commands` to include more command handlers
- Set `options.cardAction.actions` to include more action handlers
- Set `options.{feature}.enabled` to enable more `ConversationBot` functionality

To learn more, visit [additional initialization customizations](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-command-response#customize-initialization).

## Customize installation
A Teams bot can be installed into a team, or a group chat, or as personal app, depending on difference scopes. You can choose the installation target when adding the App.
- See [Distribute your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish-overview) for more install options.

  ![Installation Target](notification/addanapp.png)

- See [Remove an app from Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/remove-an-app-from-teams-0bc48d54-e572-463c-a7b7-71bfdc0e4a9d) for uninstallation.

## Customize the command logic

The default command logic simply returns a hard-coded Adaptive Card. You can customize this logic with your customize business logic. Often your business logic might require you to call your existing APIs.

Teams Toolkit enables you to [easily connect to an existing API](#connect-to-existing-apis).

<p align="right"><a href="#How-to-create-a-workflow-bot">back to top</a></p>

## Add more card actions

You can use the following 4 steps to add more card action:
1. [Step 1: add an action to your Adaptive Card](#step-1-add-an-action-to-your-adaptive-card)
2. [Step 2: add adaptive card for action response](#step-2-add-adaptive-card-for-action-response)
3. [Step 3: add action handler](#step-3-add-action-handler)
4. [Step 4: register the action handler](#step-4-register-the-action-handler)

### Step 1: add an action to your Adaptive Card
User universal action `Action.Execute` to define your action in an adaptive card, which will be rendered as a button in the card:
Here's a sample `Action.Execute`action:
```json
{ 
  "type": "AdaptiveCard", 
  "body": [
    ...
    {
      "type": "ActionSet",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "Action.Execute",
          "title": "DoStuff",
          "verb": "doStuff" 
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ... 
} 
```

> **_NOTE:_**  the `verb` property is required here so that the TeamsFx conversation SDK can invoke the corresponding action handler when the action is invoked in Teams. You should provide a global unique string for the `verb` property, otherwise you may experience unexpected behavior if you're using a general string that might cause a collision with other bot actions. 

### Step 2: add adaptive card for action response
For each action invoke, you can return a new adaptive card to display the response to end user. You can use [adaptive card designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) to design your card layout according to your business needs.

To get-started, you can just create a sample card (`responseCard.json`) with the following content, and put it in `bot/src/adaptiveCards` folder:

```json
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "size": "Medium",
      "weight": "Bolder",
      "text": "This is a sample action response."
    }
  ],
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "version": "1.4"
}
```

### Step 3: add action handler 

Add handler to implements `TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler` to process the logic when corresponding action is executed.

Please note:
* The `triggerVerb` is the `verb` property of your action. 
* The `actionData` is the data associated with the action, which may include dynamic user input or some contextual data provided in the `data` property of your action.
* If an Adaptive Card is returned, then the existing card will be replaced with it by default.

```typescript
import { AdaptiveCards } from "@microsoft/adaptivecards-tools";
import { TurnContext, InvokeResponse } from "botbuilder";
import { TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler, InvokeResponseFactory } from "@microsoft/teamsfx";
import responseCard from "../adaptiveCards/responseCard.json";

export class Handler1 implements TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler { 
    triggerVerb = "doStuff";

    async handleActionInvoked(context: TurnContext, actionData: any): Promise<InvokeResponse> { 
        const responseCardJson = AdaptiveCards.declare(responseCard).render(actionData);
        return InvokeResponseFactory.adaptiveCard(responseCardJson);
    } 
} 
```

> Note: you can follow [this section](#customize-card-action-handler) to customize the card action handler according to your business need. 

### Step 4: register the action handler

1. Go to `bot/src/internal/initialize.js(ts)`;
2. Update your `conversationBot` initialization to enable cardAction feature and add the handler to `actions` array:

```typescript
export const conversationBot = new ConversationBot({ 
  ... 
  cardAction: { 
    enabled: true, 
    actions: [ 
      new Handler1() 
    ], 
  } 
}); 
```

For more code snippets and details, refer to [this document](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-card-action-response#).

<p align="right"><a href="#How-to-create-a-workflow-bot">back to top</a></p>

## Customize the action response

### Customize how action responses are sent
You can use the `adaptiveCardResponse` property in handler to customize how the bot send the adaptive card to users. There're 3 options to customize:
- `AdaptiveCardResponse.ReplaceForInteractor`: this is the default behavior. The response card will be replaced the current one (the card where the button is defined) for the interactor who trigger the action. And user users in the conversation still view the original action card.
![image](https://github.com/dooriya/WorkflowBot/blob/main/assets/replace-for-interactor.gif)

- `AdaptiveCardResponse.ReplaceForAll`: The response card will be replaced the action card, and all users in the chat can view this response card.
![image](https://github.com/dooriya/WorkflowBot/blob/main/assets/replace-for-all.gif)

- `AdaptiveCardResponse.NewForAll`: The response card will be sent as a separate message in the conversation that won't replace the action card. And all users in the chat view this card response.
![image](https://github.com/dooriya/WorkflowBot/blob/main/assets/new-for-all.gif)

### Response with text message
Instead of using adaptive card for card action response, you can simply respond with a text message using ` InvokeResponseFactory.textMessage`:

```typescript
async handleActionInvoked(context: TurnContext, actionData: any): Promise<InvokeResponse> {
    return InvokeResponseFactory.textMessage("This is a sample card action response!");
}
```

The response message will be rendered in Teams as below:

<img src="https://github.com/dooriya/WorkflowBot/blob/main/assets/info-message-response.png" alt="info-message-response" width="600"/>

### Response with error messages
For some case you may want to return error response to the client. Then you can leverage the `InvokeResponseFactory.errorResponse` to build your invoke response, for example:

```typescript
async handleActionInvoked(context: TurnContext, actionData: any): Promise<InvokeResponse> {
    return InvokeResponseFactory.errorResponse(StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST, "You input is invalid!");
}
```

The response message will be rendered in Teams as below:

<img src="https://github.com/dooriya/WorkflowBot/blob/main/assets/error-message-response.png" alt="error-message-response" width="600"/>

> **_Note:_** for more details about the invoke response format, you can refer to [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/adaptive-cards/authoring-cards/universal-action-model#response-format).

### Customize the adaptive card content
You can edit the file `src/adaptiveCards/helloworldCommand.json` to customize the Adaptive Card to your preference. The file `src/cardModels.ts` defines a data structure that is used to fill data for the Adaptive Card.

The binding between the model and the Adaptive Card is done by name matching (for example,`CardData.title` maps to `${title}` in the Adaptive Card). You can add, edit, or remove properties and their bindings to customize the Adaptive Card to your needs.

You can also add new cards if appropriate for your application. Please follow this [sample](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-adaptive-card-sample) to see how to build different types of adaptive cards with a list or a table of dynamic contents using `ColumnSet` and `FactSet`.

<p align="right"><a href="#How-to-create-a-workflow-bot">back to top</a></p>

## Auto-refresh to user-specific view

Earlier if Adaptive Cards were sent in a Teams channel / group chat, all users would see the exact same card content. With the introduction of [refresh model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/universal-actions-for-adaptive-cards/work-with-universal-actions-for-adaptive-cards#refresh-model) for Adaptive Cards Universal Action, User Specific Views can be provided to users. In this way, the same Adaptive Card can now refresh to a User Specific Adaptive Card. It provides powerful scenarios like approvals, poll creator controls, ticketing, incident management, and project management cards.

### How it works?
The following diagram illustrated how to provide user-specific view with `refresh` model:
![image](https://github.com/dooriya/WorkflowBot/blob/main/assets/user-specific-view.png)

* `Base card`: The bot sends the message with the base version of the card. This base card can be sent as a bot notification, or command response, or any card action response. All members of the conversation can view the same. The base card will be automatically refreshed to the users defined in `userIds` in the `refresh` property of the base card. 
* `Refresh behavior`: Teams clients will automatically trigger a refresh when a user views the message and the last refresh response is older than a minute. The user-specific view handler will be invoked to return a card view (`Response Card`) for specific user (`UserA`). And for other users in the conversation, they still view the base card. 

The following gif illustrated how user-specific views shows in Teams:
![user-specific-views](https://github.com/dooriya/WorkflowBot/blob/main/assets/user-specific-views.gif)

#### Steps to add user-specific view
Below are the steps to implement this pattern with TeamsFx SDK.

1. [Step 1: enable refresh in a base adaptive card](#step-1-enable-refresh-in-a-base-adaptive-card)
2. [Step 2: add use-specific adaptive cards](#step-2-add-use-specific-adaptive-cards)
3. [Step 3: add card action handler to refresh views](#step-3-add-card-action-handler-to-refresh-views)
4. [Step 4: register the action handler](#step-4-register-the-action-handler-1)

#### Step 1: enable refresh in a base adaptive card
As illustrated above, user-specific views are refreshed from a base card (e.g. the `card2` is refreshed from `card1`). So you need to enable `auto-refresh` on the base card (e.g. the `card1`). There're two options to achieve this:

**Option 1**: enable user-specific view refresh with SDK
The base card can be sent as a command response or a card action response. So you can enable user-specific view refresh in a `handleCommandReceived` of a command handler, or in a `handleActionInvoked` of a card action handler where the base card iss returned.

Below is a sample that a return a case card as a command response that can auto-refresh to specific user (e.g. the command sender). 
You can use the `refresh(refreshVerb, userIds, data)` method from the `@microsoft/adaptivecards-tools` library to inject a `refresh` section into your base card and need to provide the following info to define the refresh section:
- `userIds`: a set of user MRIs for who can trigger auto refresh.  For more information on how to add in userIds list in refresh section of Adaptive Card, see [fetch roster or user profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/get-teams-context?tabs=dotnet#fetch-the-roster-or-user-profile).
- `verb`: a string to identify the refresh action.
- `data`: an optional data to associated with the refresh action.    

```typescript
import baseCard from "../adaptiveCards/baseCard.json";
import { AdaptiveCards } from "@microsoft/adaptivecards-tools"; 

export class MyCommandHandler1 implements TeamsFxBotCommandHandler {
  triggerPatterns: TriggerPatterns = "helloWorld";

  async handleCommandReceived(
    context: TurnContext,
    message: CommandMessage
  ): Promise<string | Partial<Activity> | void> {
    const refreshVerb = "userViewRefresh";        // verb to identify the refresh action
    const userIds = [ context.activity.from.id ]; // users who will be refreshed
    const data = { key: "value"};                 // optional data associated with the action

    const responseCard = AdaptiveCards
        .declare(baseCard)
        .refresh(refreshVerb, userIds, data)
        .render(cardData);
    
    return MessageFactory.attachment(CardFactory.adaptiveCard(responseCard));
  }
}
```

**Option 2**: enable user-specific view refresh in your adaptive card

Here's the sample refresh action defined in `baseCard.json`: 

```json
{ 
  "type": "AdaptiveCard", 
  "refresh": { 
    "action": { 
      "type": "Action.Execute", 
      "title": "Refresh", 
      "verb": "userViewRefresh" ,
      "data": { 
        "key": "value" 
      }
    }, 
    "userIds": [ 
      "${userID}" 
    ] 
  }, 
  "body": [ 
    ... 
  ], 
  ... 
}
```

You need to replace `${userID}` with user MRI in code when rendering your card content.

#### Step 2: add use-specific adaptive cards
You need to design the user-specific to refresh to specific users (e.g. `responseCard.json` for userA in above sample). To get started, you can create a `responseCard.json` with the following content, and put it in `bot/src/adaptiveCards` folder:

```json
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "size": "Medium",
      "weight": "Bolder",
      "text": "This is a user-specific view"
    }
  ],
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "version": "1.4"
}
```

#### Step 3: add card action handler to refresh views
Add handler that implements `TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler` to process the refresh invoke activity which is automatically triggered in Teams.

```typescript
import responseCard from "../adaptiveCards/responseCard.json"; 

export class Handler1 implements TeamsFxBotCardActionHandler { 
    triggerVerb: string = "userViewRefresh";
 
    async handleActionInvoked(context: TurnContext, actionData: any): Promise<InvokeResponse> {
      /**
       * If you have multiple userIds defined in your refresh action, for example: userIds: [ "<UserA>", "<userB>" ] ,
       * and you can return different card response for those users respectively with the following code sample.
        
        const currentUserId = context.activity.from.id;
        switch (currentUserId) {
          case "<userA's id>":
            const card1 = AdaptiveCards.declare(card1).render(actionData);
            return InvokeResponseFactory.adaptiveCard(card1);
          case "<userB's id>":
            const card1 = AdaptiveCards.declare(card2).render(actionData);
            return InvokeResponseFactory.adaptiveCard(card2);
        }
     */
      const responseCardJson = AdaptiveCards.declare(responseCard).render(actionData);
      return InvokeResponseFactory.adaptiveCard(responseCardJson);
    } 
} 
```
 
#### Step 4: register the action handler 
Register the refresh action handler in `bot/src/internal/initialize.js(ts)`: 
```typescript
export const commandBot = new ConversationBot({ 
  ... 
  cardAction: { 
    enabled: true, 
    actions: [ 
      new Handler1() 
    ], 
  } 
}); 
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to extend workflow bot with Notification feature

The notification feature adds the ability for your application to send Adaptive Cards in response to external events. For example, when a message is posted to `Event Hub` your application can respond and send an appropriate Adaptive Card to Teams.

To add the notification feature:

1. Go to `bot\src\internal\initialize.js(ts)`
2. Update your `conversationBot` initialization to enable notification feature:
    ```typescript
    const conversationBot = new ConversationBot({ 
      ... 
      cardAction: { 
        enabled: true, 
        actions: [ 
          new Handler1() 
        ], 
      },
      notification: {
        enabled: true
      } 
    }); 
    ```

3. To quickly add a sample notification triggered by a HTTP request, you can add the following sample code in `bot\src\index.js(ts)`:

    ```typescript
    server.post("/api/notification", async (req, res) => {
      for (const target of await conversationBot.notification.installations()) {
        await target.sendMessage("This is a sample notification message");
      }
    
      res.json({});
    });
    ```

4. Uninstall your previous bot installation from Teams, and press `F5` to start your application.
5. Send a notification to the bot installation targets (channel/group chat/personal chat) by using a your favorite tool to send a HTTP POST request to `https://localhost:3978/api/notification`.

To learn more, refer to [the notification document](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-notification).

### How to extend workflow bot with Command and response feature

The default workflow bot comes with command and response, you can follow [this document](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-create-command#How-to-add-more-command-and-response) to add more command and responses.
